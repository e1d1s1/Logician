    <h2>Overview of the Interface</h2>
    <img src="Figure1.png" alt="Screenshot of open project" /><p>
    The above screenshot shows a typical DecisionLogic session when working with an active project.&nbsp; 
    The left panel contains a tree view which contains the all of rule tables in the 
    project in hierarchical form, as they are stored on disk as individual *.xml files.&nbsp; Any folder 
    groups will show up with a folder icon from which containing tables can be 
    expanded and selected.</p><p>
    The right panel shows a typical table view when a user selects an item in the 
    tree view for editing.&nbsp; In the example above, the rules flow left to right 
    from input conditions to the outputs.&nbsp; The first row shows whether each column 
        is an input or an output condition.&nbsp; The sencond row contains the attribute 
        names.&nbsp; The checkbox in the top left corner 
    of the table indicates whether the table should return the collection of all 
    true results (checked), or only the ouput of the first encountered true row 
    (unchecked).&nbsp; The orientation of the tables can be adjusted to a top to bottom 
        type view under the Table menu.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating a Project</h2><p>
    A new project can be started from the menu File-&gt;New Project.&nbsp; You will be 
    prompted to save a *.dlp file to some location.&nbsp; It is at this save 
    location where any additional rule table files will also be stored, and 
    considered the &quot;root&quot; level of the project.</p>
