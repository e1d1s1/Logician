Logician Suite Commercial Licensing Information

DigiRule LLC provides its EDSEngine and Relational Object Modeler client libraries under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors and open source projects.  All of the libraries and tools in this package are GPL and distributed as the "Logician Suite".

For Distributors of Commercial Applications:
Users that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with Logician client libraries and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with DigiRule LLC.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with Logician Suite software, DigiRule LLC's open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, DigiRule LLC makes its GPL-licensed Logician client libraries available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those Logician client libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.

FAQ
Q1: As a commercial user, I have basic questions about the GPL. Where can I find more information?
A: Go to the Free Software Foundation’s website to read the GPL. The Free Software Foundation also provides a detailed FAQ on the GPL. 

Q2: As a commercial user, I have questions about how to comply with the terms of the GPL. Where can I find more information?
A: Reading the GPL itself is the best place to start. Go to the Free Software Foundation's website to read the GPL. The Software Freedom Law Center has also created "A Practical Guide to GPL Compliance" with its explanation of the GPL's requirements. 

Q3: As a commercial user, when should I purchase a commercial license for Logician Suite software?
A: Users that want the benefits of embedding commercial binaries of Logician Suite software in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the GPL and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications should purchase a commercial license from DigiRule LLC. Purchasing a commercial license means that the GPL does not apply, and a commercial license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements.

Q4: What is DigiRule LLC’s dual license model for Logician Suite software?
A: DigiRule LLC makes its EDSEngine and Relational Object Modeler client libraries available under both the GPL and a commercial license. As a result, developers who use or distribute open source applications under the GPL can use the GPL-licensed Logician Suite software, and commercial users that do not want to combine or distribute the Logician Suite software with their own commercial software under a GPL license can purchase a commercial license. 

Q5: What open source licensing options does DigiRule LLC offer for its Logician Suite software?
A: DigiRule LLC makes its DecisionLogic rules editor EDSEngine, and Relational Object Model client libraries available under the GPL for use with other GPL-licensed software and FOSS applications licensed under GPL-compatible FOSS licenses.
In addition, for open source projects and developers creating and distributing open source software under certain FOSS licenses other than the GPL, DigiRule LLC makes its GPL-licensed EDSEngine client libraries available under a FOSS Exception that allows distribution of the FOSS application with the EDSEngine client libraries without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL. 

Q6: What is DigiRule LLC's commercial license for Logician Suite software?
A: DigiRule LLC offers a commercial license for all of its applicable Logician Suite software that is embedded in or bundled with another application. The commercial license allows commercial users to distribute commercial binaries of Logician Suite software with their own commercial software without subjecting that software to the GPL and its requirement to distribute source code. 

Q7: Do any licensing terms apply to the XML or compressed XML files generated by the DecisionLogic rules editor?
A: No.  Only the application itself is covered by a license.  Anything it produces is just text, upon which you can apply your own copyright just like any other work of "text" you might produce by hand.  You can feel free to use the application itself for any puprose, free or commercial.

Q8: If I have more questions, who should I contact?
A: For more information, please contact an DigiRule LLC sales representative.
