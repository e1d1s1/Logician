2. Commercial Enterprise Instance Licenses and Services.

The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (RAM) or installed into the permanent memory of a computer--for example, a hard disk, CD-ROM or other storage device for the processing of the Software.  There are no restrictions on the number of applications installed on the same server and that share the same installation of the Software. There are no restrictions on the number of CPUs on this computer. There are no restrictions on the number of clients using these server-based applications.
For each Paid Server during each Term, eLogician hereby grants to the Customer a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to:
(a) use Product in source code form or compiled object code form in connection with the Customer's internal buisness operations or public web sites.
(b) modify the provided "major version" Product source code as desired and redeploy to the Customer's internal buisness operations.  For example, if you enter under an agreement under version number 1.0, then you can feel free to download source code updates from the public project repository for that major verion for as long as they are provided (1.1, 1.2, and so forth).  This does not grant you a license to download and modify subsequent major versions of the software, such as version 2.0, etc.
(c) use any additionally provided Commercial Software in source code form for testing purposes
(d) use any additionally provided Commercial Software in object code form in connection with Customer’s internal business operations or public web sites.

2.5 eLogician will provide Licenses to Customer and Customer agrees it will use or apply such Licenses on no more than the quantity of Servers set forth in this Agreement (including any quantity increases pursuant to Section 3.2). Any unauthorized use of Licenses will be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement.
2.6 If and only if Third Party Distribution rights are explicitly granted by eLogicin on the Order Form as part of the sales agreement, eLogician hereby grants to the Customer a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to distribute the compiled object code form of the original or modified Product and additionally provided Commerical Software with Customer's own applications to third parties as desired provided the derived application could not reasonably be construed as a "competing" product to Logician Suite, unless this no-compete/rebranding clause is also waived in writing by eLogician.  In this case the "Paid Server" will be understood to be any computer with Product source or a code compiler that utilizes the Product source code or object code in order to create the Third Party Distribution, including developer machines and build boxes.  Otherwise distribution is not permitted.

3. Delivery; Additional Servers.

Upon written notice, eLogician may elect to discontinue Services (including Upgrades) to the Customer under this Agreement if timely payment is not received for an applicable Term, for the period such non-payment continues. Further, in the event that Product is purchased through a reseller rather than directly through eLogician, Customer's Services (including Upgrades) will be suspended if the reseller fails to pay all amounts due to eLogician.
